Hello,

I have created a spring boot application here with a couple of endpoints 
that query the album web service, and parse them.

To run this application:

1. import it into Eclipse / IntelliJ as a Maven project
2. find & right click the pom.xml, Maven > Reload/Update project
3. under com.app.albumapi right click AlbumApplication.java, Run As > Java Application
4. go to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/#/album-controller in your browser

I have written 6 unit tests to go alongside the main app as well.

Thank you for your time!
Please shoot me an email if there are any questions or complications at rohitsehgal1998@gmail.com
